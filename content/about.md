Hey ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ryan Prairie.
I'm a 4th year computer science student at the University of Windsor.
As my friends says, I do the beep boops.

I am currently working at Nvidia as a Security Software Engineer Intern.
I've also worked at Re:Sources IT, CIBC, BlackBerry, and Trexo Robotics.

I am interested in security, distributed systems, programming languages, networking, and concurrent systems.

My non-work related interests are board games, cocktail mixing, movies, and video games.

Opinions given here are my own, not any employer or organization that I am a part of.
